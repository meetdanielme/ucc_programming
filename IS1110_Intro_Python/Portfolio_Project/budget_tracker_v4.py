# AI TOOL USAGE STATEMENT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT (GPT-5, OpenAI, https://chat.openai.com)
# and PyCharm’s built-in code completion features for minor guidance during the
# development of this project.
#
# Purpose of AI assistance:
# - To receive step-by-step guidance on implementing input validation and conditional logic.
# - To clarify Python syntax and structure while writing modular functions.
# - To debug and improve readability of code comments and docstrings.
#
# Example Prompts Used:
# - “Add input validation using try and except to handle non-numeric or negative values.”
# - “How should I structure my budget calculator into reusable functions?”
# - “Explain how to return multiple values from a Python function.”
#
# Evaluation & Adaptation:
# The AI’s output was critically reviewed and edited for correctness, simplicity,
# and compliance with IS1110 assessment requirements. Only explanatory and syntactic
# guidance was used — no full code segments were copied verbatim.
