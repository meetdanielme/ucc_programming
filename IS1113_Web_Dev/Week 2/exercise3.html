    <p>
        In <b>XHTML</b>, there are a number of <em>different</em> elements that change the apperance of the page's content when used. Some tags will render the content in exactly the same way but their <strong>meaning</strong> is different. After all, <b>XHTML</b> is primarly a way of structuring the content of a document. In later chapters we will see better ways of formatting content. For now, though, the tags that we learned in this Lab will suffice.

    <h2>Special Characters and Formatting:</h2>
    <p>
    <font color="white">
     Some characters in <b>XHTML</b> have a special code to render them on the browser. If you want to render tags in the browser we use the "less than" and "greater than" symbols e.g. <strong>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</strong>. There are other characters such as the ampersand &amp;, the copyright &copy; and the euro: &euro; <br />
    Then there are tags for adding <sub>subscript</sub> and for adding <sup>superscript</sup> and tags for putting a <strike>strikethrough</strike> the content.
